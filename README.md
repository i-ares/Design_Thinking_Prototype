# SAM_Transport_Hub
A comprehensive web-based transportation solution designed to address the commuting challenges faced by IIT Hyderabad students. Limited public transport options, especially during peak hours, weekends, and festivals, result in unpredictable commutes and logistical challenges.

Seamless Transportation for IITH Students
SAM Transport Hub is an innovative web platform designed to solve the commuting challenges faced by IIT Hyderabad students. By integrating bus booking, carpooling, and auto-sharing services into a single intuitive interface, we're transforming how students travel between campus and key locations in Hyderabad.
The Problem We Solve
Located on the outskirts of Hyderabad, IITH students face significant transportation barriers: limited public transport options, unpredictable schedules during peak hours, frustrating commute experiences during weekends and festivals, and a lack of coordinated transportation solutions.

Design Thinking Approach
Our development process followed the core principles of design thinking:
1. Empathize: We conducted extensive interviews with IITH students to understand their transportation pain points
2. Define: We identified key challenges around schedule unpredictability and limited options
3. Ideate: We brainstormed multiple solution approaches before landing on our integrated platform
4. Prototype: We developed an intuitive interface with location suggestions and visual booking flows
5. Test: Continuous user feedback shaped our final implementation

Future Roadmap
Real-time vehicle tracking, AI-powered demand prediction, mobile application development, and integration with payment gateways.
